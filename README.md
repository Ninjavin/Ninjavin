## About Me

👋 Hey there, I'm **Ninjavin**, a passionate software developer with a knack for ninja-level problem-solving and coding skills. Just like a stealthy ninja, I silently debug code and swiftly execute projects.

🌱 I'm always eager to learn and keep up with the latest trends in the tech world. I believe in the power of open source and love to contribute to projects that inspire me.

💼 Currently, I'm honing my ninja skills full-time at Oracle as an MTS (SDE-2).

🚀 In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, writing technical articles, and experimenting with new technologies.

🌅 When I'm not mastering the art of code, you'll often find me chasing sunrises and sunsets with my camera, all while listening to soul-soothing indie folk music.

🏏 **MS Dhoni** is my idol for his cool-headed leadership, and I like to think of myself as having the fiery determination of **Virat Kohli** when tackling challenging projects.
